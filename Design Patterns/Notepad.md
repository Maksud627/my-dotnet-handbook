- first take idea of DRY
- then go for SOLID
- design pattern is not solution to any specific problem, we develope something and then if we face that here this pattern needs to be applied, then we apply the pattern there.
- approach as i have a problem in my code, now in order to fix it, i need to apply this pattern, don't use it as in order to be a better developer, i need to apply this pattern.
